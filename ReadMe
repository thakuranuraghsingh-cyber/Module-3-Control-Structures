#  File Handling in Python

This project demonstrates **basic file handling operations in Python**, including creating, reading, writing, appending, and handling missing file errors.

---

##  **Task 1: Read a File and Handle Errors**

###  **Description**

This program creates a text file named **`sample.txt`**, writes a few lines into it, and then reads and prints its content line by line.
If the file does not exist, it displays an appropriate error message.

### **Concepts Used**

* File creation using **write (`'w'`) mode**
* Reading a file using **read (`'r'`) mode**
* Exception handling using **`try–except`**
* Looping through file content line by line


###  **Error Handling Example**

If `sample.txt` is deleted or missing:

```
Error: The file 'sample.txt' was not found.
```

##  **Task 2: Write and Append Data to a File**

###  **Description**

This program allows the user to:

1. Enter text to be **written** into a file named `output.txt`.
2. Enter additional text to be **appended** to the same file.
3. Finally, it **reads and displays** the complete content of the file.

###  **Concepts Used**

* Writing to a file using `'w'` mode
* Appending to a file using `'a'` mode
* Reading file content using `'r'` mode
* User input handling
